# Test 1: Simple wildcard with pipe
ls -la /tmp/wildcard_test/*.txt | grep "file" | wc -l | grep "3"

# Test 2: Multiple wildcards in same pipe
cat /tmp/wildcard_test/*.txt | grep "file" | grep -v "3" | wc -l | grep "2"

# Test 3: Wildcards across multiple files with different extensions
cat /tmp/wildcard_test/*.py | grep "Python" | wc -l | grep "2"

# Test 4: Complex pipe with wildcards and sorting
ls -la /tmp/wildcard_test/*.txt /tmp/wildcard_test/*.py | sort | grep ".py\|.txt" | wc -l | grep "5"

# Test 5: Globbing and text processing
cat /tmp/wildcard_test/*.txt | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | grep "FILE" | wc -l | grep "3"

# Test 6: Multiple wildcard patterns with filtering
ls -la /tmp/wildcard_test/*.py /tmp/wildcard_test/*.sh | grep -v "config" | wc -l | grep "3"

# Test 7: Using wildcards to count specific content
grep -l "Python" /tmp/wildcard_test/* | wc -l | grep "2"

# Test 8: Wildcard expansion with multiple commands in pipe
find /tmp/wildcard_test -name "*.txt" | xargs cat | grep "file" | wc -l | grep "3"

# Test 9: Nested directory wildcards with grep
mkdir -p /tmp/wildcard_test/subdir

# Test 10: Combination of wildcards with redirection
cat /tmp/wildcard_test/*.py | grep "Python" > /tmp/wildcard_test/result.txt

# Test 11: Complex sorting with multiple wildcards

# Test 13: Wildcard in the middle of filename
ls -la /tmp/wildcard_test/*ile*.txt | grep "file" | wc -l | grep "3"

# Test 14: Multiple different wildcards in one command
cat /tmp/wildcard_test/*.{py,sh} | grep -E "Python|shell" | wc -l | grep "2"

# Test 15: Wildcards with advanced text processing
