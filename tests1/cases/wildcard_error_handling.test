# Test cases for error handling with wildcards in pipes

# Setup test environment
mkdir -p /tmp/wildcard_errors


# Test 1: Expect failure with invalid pipe sequence
EXPECT_FAIL: ls -la /tmp/wildcard_errors/* |

# Test 2: Pipe with invalid command but valid wildcard
EXPECT_FAIL: invalidcommand /tmp/wildcard_errors/*.txt | grep "test"

# Test 3: Empty command expansion with pipe
# This should expand to empty and not be considered an error
